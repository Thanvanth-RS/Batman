# Batman
The "Batman Turtle" is a fun concept where a turtle graphics program is used to draw a bat-shaped figure representing Batman. The turtle uses yellow color on a black background to create a stylized bat silhouette, with wings drawn using circles. This design symbolizes Batmanâ€™s iconic bat motif using simple geometric shapes in Python Turtle.
